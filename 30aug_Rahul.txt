Day 9:
BIG DATA
1. 4 Vs (Volume, Variety, Velocity and Veracit)
2. Batch Processing (NEFT) and Stream Processing (UPI)
3. *Customer CRM Real Life example for placing an order
4. Parallel + Distributed Processing is required for Big Data Analysis
5. Hadoop was for batch processing and Spark is for stream processing

How Spark works? (We gonna write pyspark for python)


Internet and Data Generation: Data is the new oil. Data is generated by and consumed by us.
Earlier data was only generated by few firms but now it is generated by all of us in huge volumes.


Data Warehousing:
This is a combination of External and Operational Data. This has a fixed schema and only structured data is used.
ACID -  Atomicity: Transaction should either occur or not occur at all.
	Consistency
	Isolation
	Durability

Data Lake:
To store semi structured data, we cannot use database, hence we must use #Data Lake# but the ACID properties are lost. Data Lake has flexible schema just like key value pair. BLOB is used for storing data.

LakeHouse:
Merging the properties of both Data Warehouse and Data lake resulted in Lakehouse. This is the best of both worlds. This supports ACID as well as can handel the semi and unstructured data.

Creation of Virtual Machines - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-windows-virtual-machine-in-azure/3-exercise-create-a-vm
Network Security, Access Control, Single Sign on, Multi-factor Security, Compliance Policy

Cloud Computing Basics:
Types - Public, Private, Hybrid
Benifits - High Availability, Fault Tolerance, Scalability, Elasticity, Global Reach, Customer Latency Capabilities, Agility, Predictive Cost Considerations, Disaster Recovery, Security
Capex and Opex:
	Capital Expenditure - The upfront spending of the money on physical infrastructure. Value reduces over time (Just like buying a car)
	Operational Expenditure - Used only when required. Payment is immeadiately done (Just like booking an uber)
Consumption Based Model: - Better Cost Prediction

-> Infrastructure as a service - You Manage:[Data & Access, Applications, Runtime, OS, VM], Provider Manages:[Compute, Networking, Storage]
-> Platform as a service - You Manage:[Data & Access, Applications], Provider Manages:[Runtime, OS, VM, Compute, Networking, Storage]
-> Software as a service - You Manage:[Data & Access], Provider Manages:[Applications, Runtime, OS, VM, Compute, Networking, Storage]

Serverless Service - Developer is not concerned with the configuration of the server, it is handled by the provider.


Azure Fundamentals:
Region pairs are made in order to protect against natural and other calamities and to upgrade the servers without affecting the end users.
Each region has physically separate availability zones which individally have their own pawer, cooling, etc.

- Azure subscription is required while starting with Azure
- Azure Resource Manager (Service) enables to update and create your services/resource
- Resource Group is a logical container (Just like a folder in your laptop): Inside this the resources are created like VM, Data Factory, Web App, etc.
**Azure Walk through
