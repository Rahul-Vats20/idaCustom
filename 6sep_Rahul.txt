adf pipeline activities-
copy data
data flow - transformation of data
rest all activities come under control flow - control the flow of the data
general activities
append variable - var data types - int,string,boolean,array
append supported only in arrays
conditions - append on success,failure,skip,completion
a pipeline can have max of 40 activities
execute pipeline - to attach a child/chain pipeline to a parent/master pipeline, use execute pipeline activity to link.
execture ssis package
fail - when pipeline fails to execute
get metadata  - data about data - gives info about file/folder in json
lookup - search files,data from tables
stored procedure
script
set variable - supports all data types
web - get,put,post api requests
webhook - group messages?
wait - waiting time b/w activities

hands on
download csv files
create ADLS gen2
upload downloaded file into input container
create ADF pipeline (PL_IDA_01)
create copy data activity - copy file from input to output container
add parameters - pipeline and dataset (input and output)
instead of taking hardcoded values, parameters are passed on to used for i/p and o/p data

triggers 
used to schedule pipeline
schedule based - scheduling intervals - minutes,hours,days,weeks,months or start date end date
tumbling window - run pipeline for previous dates,
storage event - any changes to storage - events such as file added, modified,deleted trigger runs pipeline

conditional operators & loops
if condition
criteria
true/false - cases
disadvantage- only works for single file/input
solution - for each operation
iterates the loop conditions for each input.
