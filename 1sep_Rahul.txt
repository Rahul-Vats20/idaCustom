- Azure SQL Database: Elastic Pool - Creating databases in elastic pool resource
- Creating Azure SQL Database: Single database with available sample databse (adventure works LT)
- learning about JOINS: inner, left, right, self, outer, cross.
- Stored procedures:
- create procedure SP_name
 ` SQl code `
- views, functions
- `select * into #tempTable from [database].[table]` : creates a temp table on the go.
- Adding a '#' in front of table name makes it a temp table: it only remains for a particular session(run)
- ##### Functions:
- Two Types: scalar and table valued
- Scalar: output as one record only, returns a single value each time it is invoked
- Table valued: returns a table, thus it can be used as a table in a query.
- Hands-On Case Study Assignment:
- Joins
- Views
- Sub Queries
- Stored Procedures
- join three tables
- get second maximum salary
- Union (removes duplicates), Union ALL (accepts duplicates, do not remove), Intersect (Common)
- Union and Union all merges tables. works only if both tables have same no. of columns and column names.
- indexing
- Inner Join:
`SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate FROM Customers INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;`
- Left Join:
`SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate FROM Customers LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;`


- #### Indexing:
- Clustered(primary key) and Non-Clustered Index (non primary/secondary key), Column stored index (generally for big data: analytics on a column)
